 A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number. 
 A number <var>n</var> is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than <var>n</var> and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds <var>n</var>. 
 As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

 Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example, 
 That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome. 
 Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).

 Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107. 
 A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65. 
 For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message. 
 Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable. 
 Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using <a href="project/resources/p059_cipher.txt">cipher.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.

 In the game, <i>Monopoly</i>, the standard board is set up in the following way: 
 A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution. 
 In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail. 
 At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square. 
 By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares. 
 Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400. 
 If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.

 Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers. 
 For example, the square number 64 could be formed: 
 In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81. 
 For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube. 
 However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09. 
 In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order. 
 But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.

 Su Doku (Japanese meaning <i>number place</i>) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept.

 A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this).

 If we are presented with the first <var>k</var> terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence. 
 As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function, <br /><var>u</var><sub><var>n</var></sub> = <var>n</var><sup>3</sup>: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ... 
 Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that "simple is best" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed. 
 We shall define OP(<var>k</var>, <var>n</var>) to be the <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first <var>k</var> terms of a sequence.

PROBLEM STATEMENT ## 109
 In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty. 
 The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively. 
 At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points. 
 There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a "doubles out" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is "bust". 
 When a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a "checkout" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull). 
 There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6: 
 Note that D1 D2 is considered <b>different</b> to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the <b>same</b> as T1 S1 D1. 
 In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for example, D3 is the <b>same</b> as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3. 
 Incredibly there are 42336 distinct ways of checking out in total.

 Considering 4-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that they cannot all be the same: 1111 is divisible by 11, 2222 is divisible by 22, and so on. But there are nine 4-digit primes containing three ones: 
 We shall say that M(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the maximum number of repeated digits for an <i>n</i>-digit prime where <i>d</i> is the repeated digit, N(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the number of such primes, and S(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the sum of these primes. 
 So M(4, 1) = 3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit prime where one is the repeated digit, there are N(4, 1) = 9 such primes, and the sum of these primes is S(4, 1) = 22275. It turns out that for <i>d</i> = 0, it is only possible to have M(4, 0) = 2 repeated digits, but there are N(4, 0) = 13 such cases. 
 In the same way we obtain the following results for 4-digit primes. 
 For <i>d</i> = 0 to 9, the sum of all S(4, <i>d</i>) is 273700.

 For example, (3, 4, 5) triangles can be placed together to form a 5 by 5 square with a 1 by 1 hole in the middle and it can be seen that the 5 by 5 square can be tiled with twenty-five 1 by 1 squares. 
 However, if (5, 12, 13) triangles were used then the hole would measure 7 by 7 and these could not be used to tile the 13 by 13 square. 
 Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less than one-hundred million, how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a tiling to take place?

 A positive integer, <i>n</i>, is divided by <i>d</i> and the quotient and remainder are <i>q</i> and <i>r</i> respectively. In addition <i>d</i>, <i>q</i>, and <i>r</i> are consecutive positive integer terms in a geometric sequence, but not necessarily in that order.

 Let ABC be a triangle with all interior angles being less than 120 degrees. Let X be any point inside the triangle and let XA = p, XC = q, and XB = r. 
 Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of X such that p + q + r was minimised. 
 Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles AOB, BNC and AMC are constructed on each side of triangle ABC, the circumscribed circles of AOB, BNC, and AMC will intersect at a single point, T, inside the triangle. Moreover he proved that T, called the Torricelli/Fermat point, minimises p + q + r. Even more remarkable, it can be shown that when the sum is minimised, AN = BM = CO = p + q + r and that AN, BM and CO also intersect at T. 
 If the sum is minimised and a, b, c, p, q and r are all positive integers we shall call triangle ABC a Torricelli triangle. For example, a = 399, b = 455, c = 511 is an example of a Torricelli triangle, with p + q + r = 784. 
 Find the sum of all distinct values of p + q + r ≤ 120000 for Torricelli triangles.

 In laser physics, a "white cell" is a mirror system that acts as a delay line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on the mirrors, and eventually works its way back out. 
 The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the equation 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> = 100 
 The section corresponding to −0.01 ≤ <i>x</i> ≤ +0.01 at the top is missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole. 
 The light beam in this problem starts at the point (0.0,10.1) just outside the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at (1.4,-9.6). 
 Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the usual law of reflection "angle of incidence equals angle of reflection." That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with the normal line at the point of incidence. 
 In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of the first bounce. <p>The slope <i>m</i> of the tangent line at any point (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) of the given ellipse is: <i>m</i> = −4<i>x</i>/<i>y</i></p><p>The normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of incidence.</p>
 The animation on the right shows the first 10 reflections of the beam. 
 How many times does the beam hit the internal surface of the white cell before exiting?

 Looking at the table below, it is easy to verify that the maximum possible sum of adjacent numbers in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal) <span style="white-space:nowrap;">is 16 (= 8 + 7 + 1).</span> 
 Now, let us repeat the search, but on a much larger scale: 
 First, generate four million pseudo-random numbers using a specific form of what is known as a "Lagged Fibonacci Generator": 
 For 1 ≤ <i>k</i> ≤ 55, <i>s</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> = [100003 − 200003<i>k</i> + 300007<i>k</i><sup>3</sup>] (modulo 1000000) − 500000.<br />
 Thus, <i>s</i><sub>10</sub> = −393027 and <i>s</i><sub>100</sub> = 86613. 
 The terms of <i>s</i> are then arranged in a 2000×2000 table, using the first 2000 numbers to fill the first row (sequentially), the next 2000 numbers to fill the second row, and so on. 
 Finally, find the greatest sum of (any number of) adjacent entries in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal).

 In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked triangle satisfies this condition having a sum of −42.

 A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5. 
 Every Monday morning, the foreman opens a new envelope, containing a large sheet of the special paper with size A1. 
 He proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then he cuts one of them in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until he obtains the A5-size sheet needed for the first batch of the week. 
 All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope. 
 At the beginning of each subsequent batch, he takes from the envelope one sheet of paper at random. If it is of size A5, he uses it. If it is larger, he repeats the 'cut-in-half' procedure until he has what he needs and any remaining sheets are always placed back in the envelope.

 A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints.<br /> By considering two line segments in plane geometry there are three possibilities:<br /> 
 Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be the case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the segments or of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint of either of the segments it is an interior point of both segments.<br />
 Consider the three segments L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, and L<sub>3</sub>: 
 It can be verified that line segments L<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>3</sub> have a true intersection point. We note that as the one of the end points of L<sub>3</sub>: (22,40) lies on L<sub>1</sub> this is not considered to be a true point of intersection. L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> have no common point. So among the three line segments, we find one true intersection point. 
 Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate 20000 numbers using the so-called "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number generator. 
 To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers t<sub>n</sub>. That is, the first line segment is given by: 
 (t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>) to (t<sub>3</sub>, t<sub>4</sub>)

 An issue when choosing <var>e</var> is that there should not be too many unconcealed messages.  <br />For instance, let <var>p</var>=19 and <var>q</var>=37.<br />
 Choose <var>p</var>=1009 and <var>q</var>=3643.<br />

PROBLEM STATEMENT ## 183
 Let N be a positive integer and let N be split into <var>k</var> equal parts, <var>r</var> = N/<var>k</var>, so that N = <var>r</var> + <var>r</var> + ... + <var>r</var>.<br />
 For example, if 11 is split into five equal parts, 11 = 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2, then P = 2.2<sup>5</sup> = 51.53632. 
 Let M(N) = P<sub>max</sub> for a given value of N. 
 It turns out that the maximum for N = 11 is found by splitting eleven into four equal parts which leads to P<sub>max</sub> = (11/4)<sup>4</sup>; that is, M(11) = 14641/256 = 57.19140625, which is a terminating decimal. 
 However, for N = 8 the maximum is achieved by splitting it into three equal parts, so M(8) = 512/27, which is a non-terminating decimal. 
 Let D(N) = N if M(N) is a non-terminating decimal and D(N) = -N if M(N) is a terminating decimal. 
 For example, ΣD(N) for 5 ≤ N ≤ 100 is 2438. 
 Find ΣD(N) for 5 ≤ N ≤ 10000.

 The game Number Mind is a variant of the well known game Master Mind. 
 Instead of coloured pegs, you have to guess a secret sequence of digits. After each guess you're only told in how many places you've guessed the correct digit. So, if the sequence was 1234 and you guessed 2036, you'd be told that you have one correct digit; however, you would NOT be told that you also have another digit in the wrong place. 
 For instance, given the following guesses for a 5-digit secret sequence, 
 The correct sequence 39542 is unique. 
 Based on the following guesses, 
 Find the unique 16-digit secret sequence.

 Here are the records from a busy telephone system with one million users: 
 The telephone number of the caller and the called number in record n are Caller(n) = S<sub>2n-1</sub> and Called(n) = S<sub>2n</sub> where S<sub>1,2,3,...</sub> come from the "Lagged Fibonacci Generator": 
 For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, S<sub>k</sub> = [100003 - 200003k + 300007k<sup>3</sup>] (modulo 1000000)<br />
 If Caller(n) = Called(n) then the user is assumed to have misdialled and the call fails; otherwise the call is successful. 
 From the start of the records, we say that any pair of users X and Y are friends if X calls Y or vice-versa. Similarly, X is a friend of a friend of Z if X is a friend of Y and Y is a friend of Z; and so on for longer chains. 
 The Prime Minister's phone number is 524287. After how many successful calls, not counting misdials, will 99% of the users (including the PM) be a friend, or a friend of a friend etc., of the Prime Minister?
